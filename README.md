# AnimalDefine

Project for Envirohacks

## Project Idea

The idea for our project was to detect animal species based on their color and shape. This would help zoologists find a specific species of animal in an area. Our plan was to recieve camera feed from a raspberry pi, and animals would be sensed. We use haar cascade files with python's opencv module to get the animal's species.

## Research

We looked at past projects and research to figure out what framework we wanted to use. We saw some example code to locate animals, but not to pinpoint the specific species. We decided to instead detect cat faces through computer webcams(real time) and through given images(given files).

## Future Decisions

In the future we will add outdoor cameras, as well as adding more species of animals through haar cascade files.
